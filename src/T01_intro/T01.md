# Reinforcement Learning Training 2025

> Round 1

# Where is RL in ML?

![bg contain right:70%](img/paste-1752209927329.png)

---

# Supervised learning

- We know _all_ the right answers (label)
- We teach machine.

---

# Unsupervised learning

- We don't know the answer.
- We let machine find structure in the data.

---

# Reinforcement learning

- We don't know _all_ the right answer
  - but we have a way to conduct _trial-and-error_ experiments.
- We let the machine _discover_ the answers.

---

# Applications

- `ChatGPT`
  - Enhanced by reinforcement learning through a technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). [[1]](https://youtu.be/WMmGzx-jWvs?si=w6SjqgyBfdlpla6D) [[2]](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)
- `Spot`
  - Utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their locomotion and manipulation capabilities. [[3]](https://bostondynamics.com/video/reinforcement-learning-with-spot)

# Reward

- A scalar value we obtain periodically from the environment.
  - Can be positive or negative
- Tell our agent how well it has behaved.
- Reflects the success of the agent's recent activity (local)
  - Not all the successes achieved by the agent so far.
- What an agent is trying to achieve is the largest _accumulated_ reward over its sequence of actions.

---

# Agent

- An agent is somebody or something who/that interacts with the environment by executing certain actions, making observations, and receiving eventual rewards for this.
- In most practical RL scenarios, the agent is our piece of software that is supposed to solve some problem in a more-or-less efficient way.

---

# Environment

- The environment is everything outside of an agent.
- The agent's communication with the environment is limited to
  - Reward (obtained from the environment)
  - Actions (executed by the agent and given to the environment)
  - Observations (some information besides the reward that the agent receives from the environment).

---

# Action

- Actions are things that an agent can do in the environment.
- We distinguish between two types of actionsâ€”discrete or continuous.
  - **Discrete actions** form the finite set of mutually exclusive things an agent can do, such as move left or right.
  - **Continuous actions** have some value attached to them, such as a car's action turn the wheel having an angle and direction of steering.

---

# Observation

- Observations are pieces of information that the environment provides the agent with that say what's going on around the agent.
- _I am guessing it is something that agent can use to make action?_
