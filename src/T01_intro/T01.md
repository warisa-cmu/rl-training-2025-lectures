# Where is RL in ML?

![bg contain right:70%](img/paste-1752209927329.png)

---

# Supervised learning

- We know _all_ the right answers (label)
- We teach machine.

---

# Unsupervised learning

- We don't know the answer.
- We let machine find structure in the data.

---

# Reinforcement learning

- We don't know _all_ the right answer
  - but we have a way to conduct _trial-and-error_ experiments.
- We let the machine _discover_ the answers.

# Applications

- `ChatGPT`
  - Enhanced by reinforcement learning through a technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). [[1]](https://youtu.be/WMmGzx-jWvs?si=w6SjqgyBfdlpla6D) [[2]](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)
- `Spot`
  - Utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their locomotion and manipulation capabilities. [[3]](https://bostondynamics.com/video/reinforcement-learning-with-spot)
